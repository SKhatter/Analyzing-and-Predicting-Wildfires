This data is prepared using the gdal utilities. 


Preparing Label of the Dataset.(file: fire2014_.tif) 
The steps to prepare the target data (2013-2014 fire perimeters) from the historical fire database are written below:
1) Reproject the original shapefile (for the system described here, it is UTM Zone 11).
2) Select and export the records from the years 2013-2014 (2013 and 2014 both inclusive).
3) Rasterize the vector data saved in the previous step.
4) Clip the rasterized data to the study area.


Preparing Cumulative Fire Frequency Feature of the Dataset (file: fire92_12_.tif)
The following explains the calculation of the cumulative fire frequencies between 1992 and 2012.
1) Change the projection of fire history dataset to the desired map projection.
2) Choose the records of the years 1992-2012.
3) Calculate the overlapping fire polygons.
4) Rasterize the vector file saved in the previous step.
5) Clip the rasterized data to the study area.

Preparing Data from Landscape File (files: band1_.tif (elevation), band2_.tif (slope), band3_.tif (aspect), band4_.tif (fuel model number).The dataset prepared for this project uses first four bands of the landscape file namely Elevation, Slope, Aspect and Fuel Model
Number.
Steps to prepare dataset features using this file are written below:
1) Warping of the original file to reproject it into a desired common projection.
2) Translating the multi-band raster to individual first four raster band files.
3) Clipping of the four single band raster data to get data of a desired area.
